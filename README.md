# Start-up-Economic-Financial-Modeling

The Excel Workbook for a company called SensiStart, Inc. SensiStart is made up of engineers and they have done a great job of forecasting their sales through market research and forecasting their expenses on their income statement. They have been told by their mentor that having income statements is not enough. They must generate balance sheets and ultimately cashflow statements to really know how much money they need to ask from outside investors.
The SensiStart team is ultra-frustrated because developing those income statements was hard enough. They are engineers not finance people! Through a friend they heard that you were taking a new venture finance class at Whitman and that means that you get all this stuff. Those statements are a piece of cake for you.
They have handed over all their work to you and have asked you to do the following:
  1. Generate the balance sheet for years 1 -3.
  - a. Yrs 1 and 2 monthly and yr 3 quarterly.
  2. Generate the cash flow statement for years 1 -3. 
  - a. Yrs 1 and 2 monthly and yr 3 quarterly.
  3. They also are not sure how to handle capital expenditures so even though they have identified what they are buying and when they have no idea what depreciation and amortization means. They have left this blank on their income statements.
  - a. You will generate a depreciation & amortization schedule based on the assumptions in the spreadsheet under Capital Budget Expenditures.
  4. They are also not sure of how to handle insurance. Their agent is telling them they have to pre- pay it at the beginning of every year. Their insurance quote is as follows:
    - • Year 1: $5,000
    - • Year 2: $7,500
    - • Year 3: $8,000
    - a. You will generate a prepaid expense schedule.

# ASSUMPTIONS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE ABOUT
  1. SensiStart has been incorporated as an S-Corp.
  2. They have outsourced manufacturing for this product and their supplier does not have much faith in them as a new company. The supplier wants to be paid up front for any orders.
  3. Their original plan was to sell their product through electronics stores, but all the electronics stores they approached said that they needed to prove they could generate sales through their own channel first. Therefore, they are selling directly from their own website. The good thing about this is that there are no accounts receivables in the first two years.
  4. You are to assume all numbers on the income statements are correct. The ONLY change you will make to the income statements will be in the depreciation line item, amortization line item and insurance expense line item. You will find these highlighted on the workbook.
  5. The trademark is amortized for 10 years and the patent for 15 years.
  6. All capital expenditures will be depreciated using a 5-year straight-line depreciation with $0 salvage value. Please read the Capital Budget Expenditures tab for planned investments.
  7. The SensiStart group has been able to scrape up $10,000 of their own money for the venture. That number can be found on the Year 1 Cash Flow statement.
  8. In Year 3 SensiStart expects to start doing business with electronics stores. To be ready for their orders and to make sure they have inventory on time they are placing a large order in May of year 2.
  9. The electronics stores (wholesale) require 90- day payment terms which SensiStart agreed to.

# EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS
  1. You ARE NOT ALLOWED to hard input ANY numbers in the balance sheet and cashflow statement. This means that everything must be linked to the other statements. The ONLY NUMBER you will hard inputting will be the Outside Capital Investment number on Year 1 of the cashflow statement (highlighted in yellow).
  2. The only hard numbers you are allowed to put in are zeros and the outside investment amount.
  3. DO NOT change any numbers on the Income Statement, Sales Projections, Costs, unless
instructed to do so.

# ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS
  1. The SensiStart team must figure out how much money they need to ask from outside investors to be able to operate past year 3. They will only be able to raise money once so it is essential that they get it right. Based on your analysis how much money (in addition to the $10,ooo they are putting in) do you recommend they ask for? Why this amount?
  2. When does SensiStart breakeven? (month and year)
  3. SensiStart just got back some key research that shows their customers are willing to pay $40 more for their product. Instead of a retail price of $89.99 they can charge $129.99. This also means that they can charge a wholesale price of $85.00.
  - a. Based on your analysis how much money (in addition to the $10,ooo they are putting in) will they need to ask for? Why this amount?
  - b. When does SensiStart breakeven? (month and year)
  4. Please go back to the first scenario where the retail price is $89.99 and the wholesale price is $55.00. SensiStart just received a quote from another supplier that lowers the variable costs to $19.80 (from $34.80).
  - a. Based on your analysis how much money (in addition to the $10,ooo they are putting in) will they need to ask for? Why this amount?
